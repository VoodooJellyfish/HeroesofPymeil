One trend that seems to be visible in the data is that the age group that generated the most revenue was 20-24 year-olds, followed by the two adjacent age brackets.  This age group made triple as many purchases as the next closest age group, and generated more than double the revenue that the next closest group generated.  This data suggests that marketing efforts should focus on people aged 15-29 years.2. Another trend visible in the data is that the overwhelming majority of the player-base is male. As expected, males generated an overwhelming majority of the revenue as well.  However, it seems that female players that make purchases are willing to spend more money per purchase than male players3. Additionally, the “Final Critic” and “Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm” items were the top-sellers, and also generated the most revenue.  To generate the most money in the future, the gaming company should try to discern what it is about these items that made people willing to purchase them. It is possible that future items could draw more purchases once these facts are understood
